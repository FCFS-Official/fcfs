# 3. Referee Panel
In FCFS matches, the mat is supervised by three referees, while the chief referee is responsible for the overall competition.

<a id="short-4"></a>

# 4. Match Procedure and Main Time
1. Athletes are called to the mat: red/black â€” to the red corner, blue/white â€” to the blue.
2. Before the start â€” enter the center, handshake, step back. At the referee's command "Fight," the match begins.
3. The command "Stop" stops the fight. After it, the match always resumes from the standing position at the command "Fight."
4. The command "Time" - end of the main match time.
5. Actions and violations committed before the time on the scoreboard (or manual timer) expires are counted. After "Stop" or "Time," actions are not evaluated.
6. Result: the referee in the center raises the winner's hand, the athletes shake hands, and leave the mat.
7. The match is conducted in clean time: the countdown begins at the command "Fight," pauses are not counted.

<a id="short-5"></a>

# 5. Throws
1. No points are awarded for an unsuccessful throw with the attacker's fall if there was no counterattack.
2. A counter-throw is an active interception of an attack with a change of its direction or a stop.
3. If the defender does not change the fall and falls together with the attacker, the throw is counted for the attacker.
4. Only throws initiated by the attacker from the standing position are counted. If the attacker is on the ground, the throw is not counted.
5. A throw without a fall means the attacker remains standing all the time. Such throws are rated higher.
6. A throw with a fall means the attacker goes to the ground themselves or leans on the opponent.
7. Lifting the opponent from the ground with a complete detachment and rotation is considered a throw from the standing position.
8. If the attacker throws the opponent from the ground position while standing, the throw is rated at half value.
9. Transitioning to a joint lock with the opponent's fall is counted as a throw in the case of a pronounced fall.

<a id="short-6"></a>

# 6. Ground Fighting

1. Ground fighting begins when both opponents are in a "lying" position. After each transition to the ground, 1 minute is allotted for grappling (30 seconds for amateurs and children under 12 years old).
2. If at the end of the allotted time for ground fighting there is a countdown for a hold, joint lock, or choke, it continues until the completion of the 10-second countdown. If a submission occurs during this period, it is recorded according to the rules. After the countdown, the match is stopped, and the opponents are raised to their feet.
3. If a joint lock or choke was secured before the end of the match signal (gong or "Time" command), the countdown for its execution continues according to the established rules - 10 seconds, despite the end of the main match time. If the opponent submits within these 10 seconds, the submission is recorded according to the rules.
4. Ground fighting continues as long as one or both athletes are taking active actions: attacking, defending, transitioning from one technique to another, or dynamically trying to change position.
5. Ground fighting stops if:
    - One of the athletes submits.
    - One of the athletes stands up.
    - Both athletes exit the working area of the mat.
    - Both athletes are fixed in a static position without attempts to attack or defend. In this case, the referee raises them to their feet.
6. Joint locks and chokeholds may only be initiated when the defender is in the "lying" position, while the attacker may be in the "standing" position.
7. The beginning of a joint lock is defined as the moment in the match when the attacker secures the opponent's limb with the intent to cause pain and creates a threat of completing the technique. The chief referee on the mat signals the start of the joint lock with the command "Submission" and begins the countdown.
8. The beginning of a choking technique is considered the moment in a match when the attacker secures the opponent's neck and creates a visible threat, apparent to the referee, of restricting or completely stopping the flow of blood to the brain or air to the lungs, with the intent to cause submission or loss of consciousness. Simulation of a choking technique is not grounds for its recognition.
9. Executing such a fixation of a joint lock or choke is scored at 1 point if it was continuously applied and created a threat of completion for 10 seconds, regardless of whether the technique is held longer than this time.
10. If a joint lock or choke does not present a threat of completion, the referee does not start the time count for its execution.
11. After completing the 10-second count for one such technique, the referee gives the command "One Point," records the awarding of 1 point and stops the count, but continues to keep the fist clenched if a dangerous position and threat of completion persists.
12. Holding the same technique does not award additional points, regardless of how long it is held. To earn subsequent points, the athlete must transition to another joint lock or choke and secure it, after which the referee begins a new time count, or finish the given technique with the opponent's submission.
13. If the threat of completing the technique disappears, the referee opens the fist and stops the count. If the threat resumes, the referee clenches the fist again and continues the count from the beginning: "One, Two, Three."
14. The number of joint locks and chokes for which points can be earned during 1 minute of ground fighting is unlimited.
15. If after the fixation begins, but not less than 3 seconds into the count, the opponent escaping the joint lock or choke stands up, while the referee continued counting and kept the hand in a fist showing a dangerous position and threat of completion, the athlete executing the technique is awarded 1 point.
16. If this occurred after 10 seconds of counting, and the referee continued to fix the dangerous position with a clenched fist, the athlete executing the technique receives 1 point for 10 seconds of execution and an additional 1 point for the opponent's escape to standing from a dangerous position.
17. If the opponent managed to stand up before 3 seconds of counting elapsed after fixation, no points are awarded to anyone.
18. Execution of a leg lock must be stopped as soon as the defender transitions to the "standing" position and secures a stable position.
19. Execution of an arm lock must be stopped as soon as both athletes are in standing position (complete separation of the opponent from the mat).
20. Execution of a choke must be stopped as soon as the defender transitions to the "standing" position.
21. A joint lock is counted as completed if during its execution the defender signals submission. A submission signal is given by a loud cry and/or repeated tapping with the hand or foot on the mat, on one's own body, or on the opponent's body. Any cry from a participant caught in a joint lock is considered a submission signal.
22. A submission signal from a choke is given by any distinct cry, gasp, and/or repeated tapping with the hand or foot on the mat, on one's own body, or on the opponent's body.
23. Stopping the match at the request of the defender under a joint lock or choke, if not caused by a rules violation by the attacker, is treated as a submission signal.
24. Submission from a joint lock or choke is recorded by the referee with the command "Stop, Submission Done" and scored at 6 points. After confirmed submission, the referee awards points and raises the athletes to standing.
25. In case of submission from a technique after a full 10-second fixation (i.e., after completion of the time count), this joint lock or choke is awarded the maximum score of 6 points, analogous to a submission that occurred during the first 10 seconds.
26. If one of the athletes, escaping a joint lock or choke, clearly crawled out together with the opponent beyond the working area boundary, while the referee continued counting or fixed the dangerous position with a clenched fist, their opponent receives 1 point.
27. If both athletes exited the working area boundaries during active mutual ground fighting, no points are awarded to anyone. In both cases (6.26/6.27) the match is stopped, and opponents are raised to standing.

# 7. Chokes and Joint Locks

## 7.1 Permitted Categories of Chokes
All types of chokes are permitted (with and without the use of clothing, with hands and legs); a complete list of permitted actions is provided in the official FCFS rules.

## 7.2 Prohibited Chokes
- Gi division only: Chokes with hands directly on the neck without using the jacket or the opponent's arm.
- Chokes with pressure on the chin. Techniques where the main impact is on the lower jaw and larynx, rather than the neck.
- Chokes affecting the spine or twisting the neck. Any techniques creating excessive load on the cervical spine.
- Belt chokes.
- Leg chokes applied only to the neck without trapping the opponent's arm.
- Straightening crossed legs creating pressure on the neck.
- Jerking and excessively aggressive chokes performed with sharp movements creating risk of serious injury to the neck or spine.

<a id="short-8"></a>

# 8. Pins/Hold Downs

1. The pin count begins at the referee's command "Hold" from the moment the attacker presses their torso to the opponent's torso (or to the opponent's arms pressed to the torso) and secures them in the "on the shoulder blades" position. The referee extends an arm palm down and counts seconds with arm movement: "Oneâ€¦ Nine." At "Ten â€“ One point" the holder is awarded 1 point. If the pin is broken earlier â€“ the count stops and the pin is not scored.
2. A pin is scored at 1 point for 10 seconds of execution. The number of pins during a match is unlimited. However, one pin is scored only once per each transition to ground.
3. A pin ends if:
    - the athlete being held transitions to "on chest," "on stomach," or "on buttocks" (but not "on lower back") position, where the angle between their back at shoulder blade level and the mat plane exceeds 90 degrees;
    - the tightness of the pin is lost and becomes insufficient for effective control of the held athlete's torso and restriction of their movement;
    - the attacker or defender transitions to applying a joint lock;
    - during the pin both athletes end up in the "off the mat" position;
    - the held athlete hooks the holding athlete's leg or torso with both legs simultaneously (hooking / leg entanglement with both legs), or crosses legs around the holding athlete's leg or torso;
    - the held athlete is in guard or half-guard position, i.e., has the holding athlete's leg under control, regardless of grip depth or strength.
4. A pin is counted as a submission if the held athlete signals surrender during its execution.
5. Stopping the bout at the request of the defender being held, if not caused by a rules violation by the attacker, is treated as a submission signal.
6. If a pin was secured before the end-of-bout signal (gong or "Time" command), or before the end of the allotted time for ground fighting, the count for its execution continues according to established rules â€“ 10 seconds, despite the end of regulation or allotted time. If within these 10 seconds the opponent submits, the submission is recorded according to the rules.

<a id="short-9"></a>

# 9. Actions Near the Mat Boundary

1. During the match, athletes do not have the right to exit the mat without the referee's permission.
2. At the referee's decision, an athlete may leave the mat to replace equipment (a side referee must accompany the athlete).
3. The "out of bounds" position is considered if:
    - in standing position, one of the athletes stepped with both feet beyond the working area boundary;
    - in "lying" position, both athletes ended up beyond the working area boundary;
    - in "lying" position, one of the athletes has contact with the area beyond the safety zone of the mat.
4. During the match, the "out of bounds" position is determined by one of the referees, and in case of disputed moments, by majority vote of the referee trio.
5. Upon finding themselves in the "out of bounds" position, athletes at the referee's "Stop" command return to the center of the mat and resume the match in the "standing" position.
6. A throw (counter-throw) that started within the working area of the mat and finished beyond it, but within the safety zone of the mat, is scored, provided that after the fall, the defender's torso remains entirely within the safety zone of the mat.
7. A throw (counter-throw) that started within the working area of the mat and finished beyond the safety zone of the mat is not scored (if any part of the defender's torso is beyond the safety zone of the mat).
8. A throw started in the "out of bounds" position is not scored.
9. A hold and joint lock may be initiated, executed, and scored while one of the athletes has contact with the working area of the mat, and the second athlete must be within the safety zone of the mat.

<a id="short-10"></a>

# 10. Scoring for Techniques and Throws
