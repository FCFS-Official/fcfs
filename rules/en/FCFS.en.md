# 1. General Provisions

**FCFS (FreeSambo Combat Fighting System)** is a modern combat-grappling discipline created for dynamic, technically rich bouts. It combines standing and ground wrestling, giving athletes a broad arsenal of technical actions and strategic options. Success depends not only on physical conditioning, but also on tactical thinking, situational control, and efficient use of technics.

## 1.1 Permitted Actions

* **Throws** – taking an opponent to the ground; scoring depends on the positions of both athletes.
* **Pins/Hold Downs** – holding an opponent in a controlled position.
* **Choke-holds & Joint-locks** – techniques that force submission; if applied correctly for the prescribed time they may score even without an actual submission.
* **Defense & Counter-attack** – escapes, reversals, counter-throws and other tactical manoeuvres.

## 1.2 FCFS Philosophy

FCFS rewards sustained technical superiority. No single throw or lock automatically ends the contest; every attack must be continued, controlled and executed with mastery. Victory is achieved through consistent dominance rather than a lucky moment, turning every bout into an intellectual contest that values adaptability, combination work and problem-solving.

Key features:

* **Minimised randomness** – the technically and tactically stronger athlete prevails.
* **Balanced emphasis** – equal importance is given to standing and ground phases.
* **Safe scoring on submissions** – points can be awarded without forcing a tap-out.
* **Inclusive progression** – a belt system for novices and an advanced scoring scheme for professionals foster continuous skill development.

<a id="header-2"></a>
# 2. Uniform and Equipment Regulations

## 2.1 Jacket

* Belt must be tied firmly; ends may not hang below mid-thigh.
* Belts earned in other combat arts may be worn at official FCFS events.

## 2.3 Footwear (Wrestling Shoes)

* Barefoot participation is allowed.

<a id="header-3"></a>
# 3. Refereeing Panel

Each FCFS bout is supervised by **three referees** on the mat, while the entire event is under the authority of a **Head Referee**.

## 3.1 Mat Referee

* Serves as the chief official for the individual bout.
* Controls the action, issues verbal commands, and records results.
* Monitors all technical actions, evaluates them, and awards points.
* May stop the contest whenever necessary.
* Delivers the final decisions during the bout.

## 3.2 Side Referees

* Positioned at the edges of the mat.
* Confirm or adjust the Mat Referee’s scoring.
* Observe the athletes’ actions to help ensure objective assessment.
* May signal for a review if they disagree with a call.

## 3.3 Head Referee

* Responsible for the organisation and conduct of the entire tournament.
* Supervises the Mat and Side Referees.
* Ensures full compliance with the rules and refereeing standards.
* May intervene whenever a contentious situation requires resolution.
* Ratifies the final results of the competition.

<a id="header-4"></a>
# 4. Contest Procedure (Regulation Time)

1. **Athlete entry.** Both competitors are called to the mat. The first‑called athlete (red uniform) stands in the red corner; the second‑called athlete (blue or white uniform) stands in the blue corner.
2. **Pre‑start protocol.** At the referee’s gesture they step to centre‑mat, shake hands, take one step back, and the bout begins on the command “**Fight\!**”
3. **Stopping the action.** The command **“Stop\!”** freezes the contest until the referee restarts it with the next **“Fight\!”**
4. **Always from standing.** After every stop, the bout **always restarts from the standing position**, regardless of where the athletes were when action was halted.
5. **Scoring window.** All technical actions and infractions executed **before** time expires on the scoreboard (or, if the clock fails, on the handheld stopwatch) are eligible for scoring; the value of a throw or penalty may be announced immediately **after** the time signal.
6. **No score after “Stop” or “Time.”** Any actions performed after the referee has called **“Stop\!”** or **“Time\!”** are disregarded.
7. **Result announcement.** At the end of the bout the referee summons the athletes to the centre, grasps their wrists and raises the winner’s arm; the athletes then shake hands and leave the mat.
8. **Timekeeping.** Match time starts with **“Fight\!”**; pauses are not included in net fight time.
9. **End of regulation.** Regulation time concludes when the scoreboard reaches zero, synchronised with the referee’s command **“Time\!”**.

<a id="header-5"></a>
# 5.  Athlete Positions

1. **Standing** – The athlete touches the mat **only with the soles of the feet** (on one or both feet).
2. **Grounded / Lying** – The athlete touches the mat with **any part of the body other than the soles** — or with **three points of contact**.
3. **Bridge** – Back toward the mat, touching the surface **only with the head and both feet**.
4. **Side Position** – The athlete’s lateral torso (or a shoulder pressed to the torso) is on the mat; the upper‑back plane forms an angle of **up to 90 degrees** with the mat.
5. **Half‑Bridge** – Back toward the mat, touching the surface **with the head and one foot** (or with a shoulder and both feet, or with one foot only).
6. **Chest / Prone Position** – The athlete lies on the chest or abdomen; the upper‑back plane forms an angle of **more than 90 degrees** with the mat.
7. **Seated / Lower‑Back Position** – The athlete touches the mat with **one or both buttocks or the lower back**.
8. **On Shoulder** – The athlete contacts the mat with the **shoulder joint**.

<a id="header-6"></a>
# 6. Throws

**A throw is any technical action in which the attacker makes the opponent lose balance and fall to the mat, touching the surface with a body part other than the soles of the feet –** **that is, entering one of the grounded positions.**

1. A failed throw in which the attacker himself lands on the buttocks, chest, abdomen, lower back, side, or back **does not award points to the opponent**, unless the opponent executes a counter‑attack.
2. A **counter‑throw** is an active defensive action that wrests the initiative from the attacker, stopping the original attack and/or redirecting the attacker’s fall.
3. If, during the counter‑attack, the defender cannot alter the character or direction of the attacker’s fall and also lands in that direction, the attacker’s throw is deemed successful.
4. Only throws **initiated while the attacker is standing** – before the opponent’s descent begins – are eligible for scoring; the opponent may already be grounded.
5. A throw is classified as **“without fall”** if the attacker remains standing from the start to the completion of the action.
6. A throw is classified as **“with fall”** if, during execution, the attacker transitions into any grounded position or braces on the downed opponent with a hand or foot to retain balance.
7. When a standing athlete **completely lifts a grounded opponent off the mat and rotates** him around the longitudinal or transverse axis (or a combination), the throw is scored the same as any throw performed from standing.
8. Any technical action executed from standing **against a grounded opponent** is valued at **half** the score of the equivalent throw performed against a standing opponent.

9. **Transition directly into a submission** that causes the opponent to fall emphatically and rapidly is scored as a throw, provided the attacker initiated the movement.



<a id="header-7"></a>
# 7. Joint‑Locks and Ground Work

**A joint‑lock is the control and fixation of the opponent’s arm or leg (with the attacker’s arms or legs) while the opponent is grounded, enabling:**

* **levering (hyper‑extension),**
* **rotational pressure in the joint, or**
* **compression of tendons or muscles,**

**and compelling the opponent to concede defeat.**

1. Ground work **begins** as soon as **both** athletes enter a grounded position; the timekeeper immediately starts the clock. After each transition to ground, **1 minute** is allotted ( **30 seconds** for amateurs and children under 12).
2. If, when that minute expires, a **10‑second count** for a pin, lock, or choke is in progress, the count continues to completion. A submission during this count is valid. The bout is then stopped and the athletes are stood up.
3. If a lock is fixed **before** the gong or the referee’s command **“Time\!”**, the 10‑second count continues despite the end of regulation time. A submission within those 10 seconds is recorded in the normal way.
4. Ground work **continues** as long as **either** athlete is active – attacking, defending, switching holds, or dynamically changing position.
5. Ground work **ends** when:
  * A submission is signalled.
  * One athlete stands up (see Exception 7.18).
  * Both athletes leave the contest area.
  * Both athletes become static without attack or defence; the referee then stands them up.
6. A lock may be applied **only when the defender is grounded**; the attacker may be standing.
7. The **start** of the lock is the moment the attacker secures the limb and clearly threatens a finish. The Mat Referee calls **“Submission\!”** and begins the count.
8. Maintaining a continuous finishing threat for **10 seconds** awards **1 point**, regardless of further duration.
9. **No count** is started if the lock poses **no realistic finishing threat**.
10. After 10 seconds the referee announces **“Ten – One point”**, records the point, and stops counting, but **keeps the fist closed** while the danger persists.
11. The **same lock** cannot earn additional points, no matter how long it is held. To score again, the attacker must transition to **another lock or choke** and fix it, whereupon a new count begins, **or** **finish the existing lock by submission**.
12. If the danger dissipates, the referee **opens the fist** and halts the count; if it resumes, the referee closes the fist and **restarts** from **“One, Two, Three…”**
13. There is **no limit** to the number of locks that may score within the 1‑minute ground period.
14. If, **three seconds or more** after the count begins, the defender stands up to escape while the referee’s fist remains closed, the attacker gains **1 point**.
15. If the stand‑up occurs **after 10 seconds** of count, the attacker gains **1 point for the 10‑second hold plus 1 additional point** for the stand‑up escape.
16. Standing up **within the first three seconds** yields **no points**.
17. A **leg lock** must be released as soon as the defender stands and secures balance.
18. An **arm lock** must be released as soon as **both** athletes are standing (complete separation of the defender from the mat).
19. Submission is indicated by a loud verbal signal **or** repeated tapping on the mat, one’s own body, or the opponent; **any cry** by an athlete caught in a lock counts as submission.
20. If the defender requests a stoppage while under a lock (not due to an attacker’s foul), it is treated as a submission.
21. On **“Stop, Submission Done”** the referee awards **6 points** and restarts the bout standing.
22. A submission **after** a full 10‑second count still receives the maximum **6 points**.
23. If an athlete **deliberately crawls out of bounds** with the opponent to escape a lock while the referee is counting or holding a closed fist, the attacker is awarded **1 point**.
24. If **both** leave the area during mutually active ground work, **no points** are awarded. In both cases the bout is stopped and restarted standing.

<a id="header-8"></a>
# 8. Choke‑Holds

**A choke‑hold is a technical action that restricts or completely stops the flow of blood to the brain or air to the lungs in order to force an opponent to submit or lose consciousness. Unlike joint‑locks, chokes do not act on the joints but work by compressing the neck.**

## 8.1 Application of Choke‑Holds

1. A choke begins at the moment the attacker secures the opponent’s neck and creates a visible threat – recognisable to the referee – of restricting blood or air flow. Feinting a choke is not grounds for a count.
2. Chokes may be initiated only when the defender is grounded; the attacker may remain standing.
3. The choke **must be released** as soon as the defender stands up.
4. If a choke is fixed **before** the gong or the referee’s command **“Time\!”**, the standard **10‑second count** continues despite the end of regulation or ground‑work time. A submission within those 10 seconds is valid.
5. A continuous finishing threat held for **10 seconds** scores **1 point**. Only **1 point** can be earned per choke.
6. Additional points for the same choke are not awarded; the attacker must switch to another lock/choke or finish the hold.
7. If the choke no longer threatens a finish, the referee stops counting.
8. **No limit** exists on the number of chokes that may score within the 1‑minute ground period.
9. After 10 seconds the referee says **“One Point”**, stops counting, but keeps a closed fist while danger persists.
10. Switching to another lock/choke and fixing it restarts a new count.
11. If danger disappears, counting stops; if it resumes, it restarts from **“One, Two, Three…”**.
12. If after at least ** 3 s** after fixation the defender stands without escaping danger, the attacker gains **1 point**.
13. If this happens after 10 s of count, the attacker gains **1 point** for the hold and **1 additional point** for the stand‑up escape.
14. Standing up **within 3 s** of fixation yields no points.
15. A choke is successful if the defender signals submission.
16. A submission is signalled by any clear verbal exclamation or gasp **and/or** repeated tapping with the hand or foot on the mat, on one’s own body, or on the opponent’s body.
17. The signal must be clear and unmistakable to the referee; **any vocal sound made by a competitor caught in a choke is regarded as a submission signal.**
18. Requesting a stop while choked (no attacker foul) is treated as submission.
19. On **“Stop, Submission Done”** the referee awards **6 points** and restarts standing.
20. Submission after a full 10‑second count still awards **6 points**.
21. Crawling out of bounds with the opponent to escape a choke while the referee is counting (fist closed) gives the attacker **1 point**.
22. If both athletes exit out of combat zone during active ground work, no points; in cases 8.20/8.21 the bout stops and restarts standing.

4. Belt chokes
5. Leg‑only chokes without arm trap (Triangle No‑Arm, Gogoplata, etc.)
6. Explosive or violent chokes (jerking Guillotine, snap chokes, violent face‑crank)

<a id="header-9"></a>
# 9. Pins/Hold Downs

**A pin is a hold in which, for a specified time, the attacker forces the opponent to lie back‑down on the mat while pressing the attacker’s torso against the opponent’s torso or against the opponent’s arms that are pressed to the torso. Torso is the central anatomical part of the body, excluding head, neck, and limbs.**

1. The pin count starts on the referee’s command **“Hold\!”** at the moment the attacker’s torso makes contact with the opponent’s torso (or with the opponent’s arms pinned to the torso) and secures the opponent **on the shoulder‑blades** (both shoulder‑blades must touch the mat surface directly, or through the attacker’s arm(s) or leg(s)).
2. A pin is scored at **1 point for every 10 seconds** of control.
3. The number of pins in a bout is unlimited; however, **each transition to ground allows a given pin to be scored only once**.
4. A pin ends if:
    * the pinned athlete turns to **chest‑down, prone, or seated** (but not lower‑back) so that the angle between the upper back (at shoulder‑blade level) and the mat exceeds **90 degrees**;
    * the tightness of the hold is lost and becomes insufficient to effectively control the opponent’s torso and restrict their movement;
    * either the attacker or the defender transitions to applying a submission hold;
    * during the hold-down both athletes end up in the “off the mat” position;
    * the athlete being held entangles the leg or torso of the holding athlete using both legs simultaneously (hooking / leg entanglement with both legs), or crosses their legs around the leg or torso of the holding athlete;
    * the athlete being held is in a guard or half-guard position, i.e., has the leg of the holding athlete under control, regardless of the depth or strength of the grip.
5. A pin is considered a **submission** if the pinned athlete signals surrender while being held.
6. Stopping the bout at the request of the pinned athlete, when not caused by an attacker’s rules violation, is treated as a submission.
7. If a pin is secured **before** the gong or the referee’s command **“Time\!”**, or before the end of the allotted ground‑work period, the 10‑second count continues under the standard rules – even after the bout time has expired. A submission within those 10 seconds is recorded in accordance with the rules..

<a id="header-10"></a>
# 10. Fixing a Submission and Stopping the Bout for Joint‑Locks and Chokes (Children and Novices)

**To increase athlete safety and reduce injuries, the following provisions apply to children under 12 years old (A‑11 / B‑11) and to beginners (White and Yellow belts).**

## 10.1 Injury‑Prevention Stoppage

1. **Explicit submission signal** – clear tapping with the hand, verbal acknowledgement, or any other obvious sign.
2. When the hold reaches the fully‑fixed phase:
  * **Arm lock** – if the arm is fully straightened and at risk of injury, the referee must immediately stop the bout and award the submission.
  * **Leg lock (knee bar)** – if the knee is fully straightened and the attacker’s legs are locked, creating tension in the joint that is in danger, the bout is stopped at once and the submission is awarded.
  * **Choke‑hold** – if the athlete loses the ability to defend actively or shows signs of unconsciousness, the referee immediately records the submission.
3. **Dangerous application of a technique** – if the referee sees that a hold is being applied dangerously (e.g., knee bar against the natural bend, Achilles crush, or any lock forcing a joint beyond its normal range), he calls **“Stop\!”** and restarts the bout **standing**, **without penalising** either athlete.
4. **Deliberately rough or prohibited technique** – if an athlete intentionally applies a hold with excessive force, brutality, or uses a banned technique, the referee issues a **caution** to the attacker.

<a id="header-11"></a>
# 11. Actions Near the Mat Boundary

1. During a bout, athletes may not leave the mat without the referee’s permission.
2. With the referee’s approval, an athlete may leave the mat to adjust or replace equipment; a side referee must accompany the athlete.
3. The position **“out of bounds”** is deemed to occur when:
    * **Standing:** one athlete steps with **both feet** beyond the contest area boundary;
    * **Lying:** **both** athletes move beyond the contest area boundary;
    * **Lying:** one athlete makes contact with the surface beyond the **mat safety zone**.
4. Out‑of‑bounds status is determined by any referee; in disputed cases, by majority vote of the referee trio.
5. Once out of bounds, athletes obey the command **“Stop\!”**, return to the centre, and restart the bout **standing**.
6. A throw (or counter‑throw) that **starts inside** the contest area and **finishes outside** it but **within the safety zone** is scored **provided** the defender’s torso remains entirely inside the safety zone after the fall.
7. A throw (or counter‑throw) that starts inside the contest area and finishes **beyond the safety zone** is **not scored** if any part of the defender’s torso is outside the safety zone.
8. A throw begun while **out of bounds** is **not scored**.
9. A pin or joint‑/choke‑hold may be initiated, executed, and scored **as long as one athlete maintains contact with the contest area and the other athlete remains inside the safety zone**.

<a id="header-12"></a>
# 12. Evaluation of Techniques and Throws

**A throw is scored according to three criteria: (a) whether the attacker remained standing (without fall) or fell with the action (with fall); (b) the defender’s position before the throw; (c) the part of the defender’s body that impacts the mat. During the bout, the value of each technical action is determined by majority vote of the referee trio.**

## 12.1 Six Points (6 Points) are awarded for

1. A throw **without fall** by the attacker in which the opponent lands on the **back** or in a **bridge** position.
2. The opponent’s **submission** caused by a joint‑lock, choke‑hold, **or** during a pin.

## 12.2 Four Points (4 Points) are awarded for

1. A throw **without fall** in which the opponent lands on the **side** or in a **half‑bridge**.
2. A throw **with fall** in which the opponent lands on the **back** or in a **bridge**.
3. A throw **without fall** executed against an opponent who was already **lying**, where the opponent lands on the **back** or in a **bridge**.

## 12.3 Two Points (2 Points) are awarded for

1. A throw **without fall** in which the opponent lands on the **chest, abdomen, buttocks, lower back, or shoulder**.
2. A throw **with fall** in which the opponent lands on the **side** or in a **half‑bridge**.
3. A throw against a **lying** opponent that results in the opponent landing on the **back** or in a **bridge**.

## 12.4 One Point (1 Point) is awarded for

1. A throw **with fall** in which the opponent lands on the **chest, abdomen, buttock(s), lower back, or shoulder**.
2. A throw against a **lying** opponent that results in the opponent landing on the **side** or in a **half‑bridge**.
3. The **first caution** issued to the opponent.
4. A **10‑second pin**.
5. A **10‑second joint‑ or choke‑hold**.
6. The defender’s **escape to standing** from a counted joint‑ or choke‑hold when the count has reached **three seconds or more**.
7. **Crawling out of the contest area** with the opponent to avoid a joint‑ or choke‑hold.

<a id="header-13"></a>
# 13. Bout to Golden Score

**The Golden Score (and, if required, the Diamond Score) provides a dynamic finish to the bout; wrestlers are expected to take the initiative instead of awaiting a judges’ decision.**

1. If regulation time ends in a draw, a **one‑minute** overtime is given – **the Golden Score period**. During this minute the bout continues **until the first decisive action** (worth **1 point or more**) **or** the first caution is awarded.
2. The Golden Score period begins on the referee’s command **“Fight\!”** and ends immediately upon the occurrence of **any** of the following:
    * A **10‑second pin** or the opponent’s submission.
    * A **10‑second joint‑ or choke‑hold** or the opponent’s submission.
    * A scoring **throw** valued at **1 point or more**.
    * The defender, escaping a counted joint‑ or choke‑hold, **stands up after three seconds or more** of count.
    * A **caution** is issued for passivity or an illegal action.
    * **Disqualification** of the opponent for a flagrant rules violation.
3. If no athlete has scored 1 point by the end of the 1‑minute overtime, the referee calls “Time\!” and the winner is decided by the referee trio, who assess:
    * Which athlete was **more active and attacking** in both standing and ground phases.
    * Which athlete **came closer** to completing a decisive action.
4. Victory is awarded to the wrestler who demonstrated the **greater activity** and a **clear attacking advantage**.

(Test version) – If, after this additional minute, the referee trio still finds the bout difficult to judge, the Head Referee may authorise an extra 30‑second period conducted under the same rules as the Golden Score. This period is referred to as the **Diamond Score**.

<a id="header-14"></a>
# 14. Interval Between Bouts

1. The rest period between an athlete’s bouts must be **no less than five (5) minutes**.

<a id="header-15"></a>
# 15. Result of the Bout

**A bout may end with a victory for one athlete and a defeat for the other, or a defeat for both athletes.**

Victory may be achieved:

1. Early (before time expires).
2. At the end of regulation time.
3. By **Golden Score**.
4. By decision of the referee trio.

<a id="header-16"></a>
# 16. Early Victory

## Early victory is awarded in the following situations:

1. When an athlete is the **first to reach twelve (12) points**, regardless of the score difference. If an athlete has fewer than 12 points and performs a scoring action worth more points than needed to reach the threshold, the bout **still ends immediately at the moment the score reaches 12**.
2. When the opponent is **withdrawn** from the bout.
3. When the opponent is **disqualified (removed from the competition)**.
4. In all such cases the bout is stopped, the athlete is declared the winner by early victory, and the finish time is recorded in the match protocol.

<a id="header-17"></a>
# 17. Victory at the End of Regulation Time and Draw

1. At the end of regulation time, the athlete with the **higher point total** is declared the winner.
2. If the score is **tied** at the end of regulation time, no winner is determined by last scoring action or by quality of techniques. The bout is declared a **draw** and proceeds to overtime under the **Golden Score** rules.

2. **First and second caution (Caution)** – Same stance; extends the coloured arm toward the offender **and** with the other hand shows the value **“1” or “2”** points accordingly.
3. **Mutual warning** – Facing the officials’ table at centre‑mat, extends one arm toward **each** athlete.

## 18.3 Pins

1. **Fixing and counting a pin** – The referee calls **“Hold\!”**, stretches forward the coloured arm **palm down**, then sweeps that arm horizontally away from the chest while counting seconds aloud: “One, two, three … nine.” Each arm movement equals one second.
2. **Completing the pin** – At **ten seconds** the referee announces **“Ten – One point”** and awards one point to the holding athlete.
3. **Escape from the pin** – If the defender breaks free, the referee stops the count and signals **“No score”** with the gesture described in Rule 18.5.3.

## 18.4  Joint‑Locks and Chokes

1. **Fixing and counting a lock or choke** – The referee calls **“Submission”**, withdraws the coloured arm **closed in a fist**, and sweeps it horizontally from the chest while counting: “One, two, three … nine.”
2. **Ten‑second mark** – At **ten seconds** the referee announces **“Ten – One point”** and awards one point to the attacking athlete.
3. **Escape from danger** – If the defender leaves the dangerous position, the referee stops the count. When the attacker fixes **another** lock or choke, a new count begins. If the danger disappears, the referee opens the fist and stops counting; if it reappears, the referee closes the fist and restarts from “One, Two, Three.”
4. **Out‑of‑bounds position** – Raises the straight arm nearest the boundary **to shoulder height**, then gives the command **“Stop\!”** and points the straight arm to the centre of the mat. The bout resumes in the centre.
5. **Submission** – The athlete’s tap or cry is fixed by the command **“Stop, Submission Done”** and scored **six (6) points**; after confirmation the referee awards the points and stands the athletes up.

## 18.5 Other Gestures

1. **Introducing the athletes** – Standing half‑turned toward the officials’ table at the mat edge, the referee raises the straight arm (in the athlete’s colour) toward that competitor. Next, both straight arms are lifted to shoulder level, knife‑edges of the palms downward, aimed toward the athletes; the hands move together, indicating the mat centre, and the referee walks there with the competitors.
2. **Start of the bout** – On the command **“Fight\!”** the referee snaps a bent arm downward between the athletes above the centre of the mat (forearm ending horizontal), then steps back to an observation position.
3. **No score (“Technique not counted”)** – Makes 2–3 horizontal left‑right sweeps with an open hand palm down, fingers together.
4. **Order to stand up** – Raises both forearms (elbows bent), open palms facing each other, forearms parallel.

13. **Attention required (side referee)** – Raises a bent arm upward, open palm forward, and moves it 2–3 times vertically.
14. **Athletes to corners** – Points both straight arms, open palms forward, toward the respective mat corners.
15. **Announcing the winner** – Standing centre‑mat facing the officials’ table, the referee holds both athletes’ wrists (sleeve colour matches athlete).
